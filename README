Program which contain a simple set of functions
that take the graph representing the web and output a file in the
DOT language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_language). This file
can be used by, for example, Graphviz (www.graphviz.org) to produce 
an ilustrative image of the graph thus making easier to understand
the results of the ranking algorithm.

This implementation mainly contain two file's 

web_crawler.py : This program(simple web crawler) is creating a web-graph and 
calculate rank's of a page using rank algorithm (Like Page rank algorithm) 
{This algorithm I learned in udacity course(CS 101)}

graph.py :Here I define the procedures that take the results from
the search engine and produce strings in appropiate format to be writen
to a DOT file. Each node has its (abbreviated) url and its rank as the
displayed name. Nodes may vary in sizes according to their rank.


To produce an actual image from the DOT file you will need to download
the Graphviz package (www.graphviz.org).

How to Run:

1.open cmd and go to directory where your both file stored 
    Like : cd C:\Users\saurabhgeek\Documents\webgraph
	
2.Run web_crawler file using following command
C:\Users\saurabhgeek\Documents\webgraph>python web_crawler.py

3.open python shell 

C:\Users\saurabhgeek\Documents\webgraph>python

4.>>>from graph import *

5.>>>make_dot_file("filename.dot", graph, ranks)

6.This will create the file filename.dot which can be used by Graphviz to produce an image
for example, an svg image, so again come back to cmd prompt (using ctrl+Z)

>>>^Z

7.C:\Users\saurabhgeek\Documents\webgraph>circo -Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg

                                               OR
											   
   C:\Users\saurabhgeek\Documents\webgraph>dot-Tsvg filename.dot -o filename.svg
